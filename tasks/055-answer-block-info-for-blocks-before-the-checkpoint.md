# Answer block info for blocks before the checkpoint

## Objective

`HeadersDB` answers every `get-stacks-block-info?`, `get-tenure-info?` and
`get-burn-block-info?` from an in-memory map holding only the blocks nano has
executed itself. A checkpoint carries no headers, so every block before it is
`none`, and any contract consulting chain history gets an answer the network
never gave.

That stopped a mainnet replay at height 8,665,719. `v0-4-market.borrow` reaches
`block-info-nakamoto-ststx-ratio-v2.get-ststx-ratio-at-block`, which does

```clarity
(block-hash (unwrap! (get-stacks-block-info? id-header-hash block) (err ERR_BLOCK_INFO)))
```

and the failure surfaces as an `unwrap-panic` further up. mainnet returned
`(ok true)`; nano returned `(err none)`.

The map is unbounded in the other direction too: it grows with every block
executed, is never written down, and a restart loses it.

## Tasks

- [x] Persist executed block headers rather than holding them in memory.
- [ ] Export the header fields Clarity can read for the checkpoint's ancestry,
      and import them alongside the trie.
- [x] Serve `HeadersDB` from the persisted store, so a restart answers what the
      run before it answered.
- [ ] Distinguish a header that is genuinely absent from one this node never
      carried, rather than answering `none` as though the block never existed.
- [ ] Replay across a block whose transactions read pre-checkpoint history and
      compare state roots.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `get-stacks-block-info?` answers for any ancestor of the executed tip,
  including blocks from before the checkpoint.
- The answer survives a restart.
- Memory does not grow with distance from the checkpoint.
- Mainnet replay passes 8,665,719.

## Header coverage was not what stopped 8,665,719

Persisting the headers was right on its own terms — the map grew with the chain
and a restart lost it — but tracing every `get_block_at_height` and header read
during the failing block showed **no miss at all**, and no contract failing to
compile either. So the `UnwrapFailure` is a Clarity-level unwrap of an `err` the
contract itself produced, and the read behind it is one nano answers with the
wrong *value* rather than with nothing.

Narrowing that needs tracing at the granularity of a single Clarity read: which
key, in which contract, returning what. The next step is that trace, not more
guessing at which surface is missing.

## What the archive already holds

`chainstate/vm/index.sqlite` carries `block_headers` for all 8.6 million blocks,
with the burn header hash, burn height, times, VRF seed, miner address, burn
spends and reward — every field `BlockHeader` needs. So this is an export and an
import, not a reconstruction.
